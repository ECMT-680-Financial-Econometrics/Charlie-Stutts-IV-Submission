When running the code in python and vsc, make sure you have the maketable4.dta file loaded into your local environment or else python/vsc won't be able to path to the datafile. The code takes a 
table with variables on gdp, institution type, and settler mortality rates and runs regressions using the mortality rates of settlers as an IV. The paper attempts to explain the complex relationships 
between institutions, geography, and human capital in shaping the economic trajectories of nations. It provides empirical evidence that supports the idea that countries with sound
institutional frameworks are more likely to achieve sustained economic development and higher income per capitas, while countries that had more extractory purposed institutions are more likely to still be struggling
in modern times.
